ML for Stock Market Prediction- Predicted prices of the stocks up to 100 days into the future by building and tuning ML models. Used ARIMA and rolling averagesto analyze trendsin the dollar exchange rates and prices of 5 large capitalstocks. Performed auto-correlation, cross-correlation and risk vs return analysis to determine the superior portfolio among them. Various machine learning techniques such as Moving averages, linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Auto ARIMA, 
Prophet, LSTM models are employed and compared to forecast the daily closing price of stocks of Tata Global Beverages.
ML for Insurance Prediction- Predicted whether an individual will purchase the insurance policy from the company or not.Led comprehensive analysis of robust health insurance data, intricately refining through meticulous procedures. Subsequently deployed state-of-the-art binary classification methodologies—leveraging Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, 
Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression—effectively demonstrating mastery over diverse analytical tools. Orchestrated a sophisticated hyperparameter optimization, showcasing acumen for fine-tuning to augment precision.  Upon careful evaluation of four classifiers on the validation dataset, the Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the clear 
frontrunner, outperforming its counterparts. With the highest accuracy of 85.93% and an impressive F1 score of 0.7724
